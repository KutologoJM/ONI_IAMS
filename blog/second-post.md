This is a regular **Markdown** paragraph.

Hereâ€™s some embedded HTML:

<div class="highlight-box">
  <h2>Custom HTML Section</h2>
  <p>This block is written in raw HTML inside the Markdown post.</p>
  <button onclick="alert('Hello from HTML in Jekyll!')">Click Me</button>
</div>

Back to Markdown after the HTML.
